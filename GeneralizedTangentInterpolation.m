function RHOrefPPs = GeneralizedTangentInterpolation(rho_0, rho_f, tangentPoints, rhodot_0, rhodot_f, t0, tf, tangentTimes)
% tangentPoints is an array of tangent points, with each column representing a point
% tangentTimes contains the times corresponding to each tangent point, including t0 and tf at the ends

% Initialize variables
N = size(tangentPoints, 2); % Number of segments is N-1, assuming tangentPoints includes initial and final points
vars = [];
equations = [];

% Loop through each segment
for i = 1:(N-1)
    % Define the symbolic variables for this segment
    % Note: We create unique variable names for each segment to avoid conflicts
    symVars = sym('a', [4, N-1], 'real'); % Adjust as needed for your variable naming scheme
    
    % Add to the overall vars array
    vars = [vars; symVars(:)];
    
    % Compute local variables, equations, and continuity conditions
    % You will need to adjust this part to correctly define the equations for each segment
    % based on the provided tangentPoints and tangentTimes
    
    % Example for continuity conditions (adjust indices and equations as needed):
    % if i < N-1
    %    equations = [equations; ...
    %                 subs(x_i_eq, t, tangentTimes(i+1)) == tangentPoints(1, i+1), ...
    %                 subs(y_i_eq, t, tangentTimes(i+1)) == tangentPoints(2, i+1), ...
    %                 subs(z_i_eq, t, tangentTimes(i+1)) == tangentPoints(3, i+1)];
    % end
end

% Solve the system of equations for the coefficients of each segment
solution = solve(equations, vars);

% Extract the coefficients from the solution and construct the piecewise polynomial
% structures for each component of the trajectory

% Return the piecewise polynomial structures
