# MoonHarbour

## Overview
MoonHarbour is an innovative project dedicated to executing rendezvous and docking maneuvers with the Lunar Gateway. This initiative plays a crucial role in advancing lunar exploration and establishing a sustainable human presence on the Moon.

## Lunar Gateway
The Lunar Gateway is an essential component of lunar exploration. It serves as a multi-purpose outpost orbiting the Moon, providing vital support for long-term human return to the lunar surface and as a staging point for deep space exploration. For more information, visit the [Lunar Gateway Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Gateway).

## Rendezvous and Docking
Rendezvous and docking are two critical phases in spaceflight involving the approach and mechanical joining of two spacecraft. This complex process includes:
- **Rendezvous**: Maneuvering the spacecraft to approach each other in orbit.
- **Docking**: Physically connecting the spacecraft to transfer crew or cargo.

## Objectives of MoonHarbour
1. **Precise Maneuvering**: Develop and implement precise orbital maneuvering techniques for successful rendezvous.
2. **Innovative Docking Solutions**: Create and integrate advanced docking systems compatible with the Lunar Gateway.
3. **Safety and Reliability**: Ensure the highest standards of safety and reliability in all rendezvous and docking operations.
4. **Supporting Lunar Exploration**: Contribute to the broader goal of sustainable lunar exploration and long-term space habitation.

## Collaboration
MoonHarbour is open to collaboration with international space agencies, research institutions, and private sector partners.
